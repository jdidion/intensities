An R library of functions for working with raw microarray intensity data. Primiarly for QC and normalization. Many of these functions are better implemented and supported in Andrew Morgan's [Argyle](https://github.com/andrewparkermorgan/argyle) package.

The main function of interest here for most people will probably be the single-function implementation of thresholed quantile normalization (tQN, [Staaf et al. 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2572624/)).
